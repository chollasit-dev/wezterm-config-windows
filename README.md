# Wezterm Config Windows

My Wezterm configuration for Windows at home. The reason I use Wezterm is because
of its cross-platform support, which helps my attempts to migrate the configuration
between Windows and Linux.

## To Get Started

Clone this configuration repository into the `.config` folders.

```ps1
git clone git@github.com:chollasit-dev/wezterm-config-windows.git "$HOME/.config/wezterm"
```
